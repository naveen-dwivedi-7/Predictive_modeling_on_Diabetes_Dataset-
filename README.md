# Predictive_modeling_on_Diabetes_Dataset
It's  a classification ML problem , in which  a model  predict and detect  that the person has diabetes or not  along with it's accuracy score on basis of person details like age ,insulin level, skin thickness ,blood pressure etc. here we used ML using  scikit learn for modeling.  it prediction  depend on outcome  which are values 0 and 1.
## 0 - No diabetes
## 1 - diabetes

Step1:Prepare and collect data.
Step2: Choose an algorithms. 
Step3: Train  ML algorithm  using train  data. 
Step4 :Evaluate/Predict  Model performance on data. 
 and other important details mentioned in a code.
